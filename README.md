# Election_Data_Analysis
# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing election commission data from the years 2014 and 2019. Using SQLfor data extraction and transformation, and PowerBI for data visualization, we aim to uncover insights and trends from the election data. The project addresses various questions related to voter turnout, party performance, and electoral patterns.

# Data Cleaning
Data might contain constituencies spelling mismatches and some constituencies may be listed with identical names. Proper validation is required. In 2014, Andhra Pradesh underwent bifurcation.

# Data Transformation
Establish suitable dimension tables and primary keys to link the CSV files effectively. Construct aggregate tables using append and groupby functions as needed to format the data appropriately for answering the queries.
